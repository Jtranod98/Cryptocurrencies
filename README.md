# Cryptocurrencies

# Overviews:

This exercise will demonstrate what unsupervised machine learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce the dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA.
The dataset for this demonstration is cryptocurrencies. The challenge is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system.

The following steps were performed:
  1.	Cleaned data, since the dataset was not ideal, data was cleaned by dropping null values and unnecessary data.
  2.	Standardized data, using the StandardScaler fit_transform function.
  3.	Fit the machine learning models, unsupervised learning was used since there was no known output for what we are looking for.
  4.	Group the cryptocurrencies, using clustering algorithm.
  5.	Show the findings, using Data visualizations, 3D scatter plot and scatter plot.
